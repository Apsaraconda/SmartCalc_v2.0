# SmartCalc_v2.0

SmartCalc is an ingeneer calculator app.
v2.0 provides type XeY exponential notation and fixes some bugs.

## Basic properties:
- Both integers and real numbers with a dot can be input into the program. .
- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation;
- Calculate arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the variable _x_ as a number;
- Plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable _x_ (with coordinate axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid);
- Domain and codomain of a function are limited to at least numbers from -1000000 to 1000000;
- Verifiable accuracy of the fractional part is at least to 7 decimal places;
- Users able to enter up to 300 characters;
  
    - **Arithmetic operators**:
